After years of searching, Elric reached the Heart Tree—its pale, silver bark glowing faintly in the twilight. 
The final symbol on the map flared once, then vanished. He laid his hand upon the trunk, expecting release. 
Instead, the forest whispered the truth: the map had never led to escape, but to acceptance. Elric had not 
wandered in by accident—he had chosen this exile, to bury a grief too great to bear.

The path out was never meant for him.

Brin whined softly, sensing the shift. Roots rose silently, curling around Elric’s feet like gentle chains. 
As the forest slowly claimed him, the wind carried one last whisper—“Stay.”

And so he did.
