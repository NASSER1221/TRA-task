After seasons of wandering, deciphering riddles etched in stone and dreams, Elric finally stood before the Heart Tree—an immense, silver-barked giant hidden in the forest’s deepest glade. 
The map, now nearly blank, pulsed faintly in his hand. As he touched the tree’s bark, the forest hushed. Visions surged—his forgotten past, the reason he entered the woods, the choice he had 
made long ago: to forget pain, to seek peace in exile.

But he had changed. He had endured, learned, grown.

The Heart Tree offered him two paths: remain, as guardian of the woods, or leave, memory restored. With Brin at his side, Elric chose freedom. Light split the canopy, and a path opened. Together, 
they stepped forward—into the world, into a future no longer whispered, but truly his.
