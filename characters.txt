Elric is a lean, sharp-featured young man with tousled black hair that falls just above his storm-gray eyes—eyes that seem to miss 
nothing, even in the dim forest light. His skin is sun-kissed and weathered from years beneath the trees, and he wears a patchwork 
cloak made of scavenged fabrics and animal hide. One key trait that defines Elric is his quiet determination; though soft-spoken and solitary, 
he possesses an unshakable resolve that drives him to keep searching, no matter how hopeless the forest may seem. It's this inner 
strength that the Whispering Woods watches—and ultimately tests.
