Elric is a lean, sharp-featured young man with tousled black hair that falls just above his storm-gray eyes—eyes that seem to miss 
nothing, even in the dim forest light. His skin is sun-kissed and weathered from years beneath the trees, and he wears a patchwork 
cloak made of scavenged fabrics and animal hide. One key trait that defines Elric is his quiet determination; though soft-spoken and solitary, 
he possesses an unshakable resolve that drives him to keep searching, no matter how hopeless the forest may seem. It's this inner 
strength that the Whispering Woods watches—and ultimately tests.


Through every shadowed glade and tangled path, Elric’s loyal dog, Brin, padded silently at his side. A scruffy, 
amber-eyed mutt with a keen nose and unmatched loyalty, Brin never questioned the journey. When the woods whispered 
lies or illusions blurred Elric’s path, Brin growled low, grounding him in reality. At night, as Elric studied the 
shifting map by moonlight, Brin curled protectively nearby, always alert. Though the forest tested Elric, it never fooled Brin. 
Their bond, forged in survival and trust, gave Elric the strength to continue. 
The map may have judged Elric alone, but Brin's steadfast presence reminded him he was never truly alone.
