The Whispering Woods Chronicle

Lost in the heart of the ancient Whispering Woods, a young man named Elric wandered beneath the dense canopy, haunted by voices carried on the wind. Trapped for years with no memory of how he arrived, 
he scoured the moss-covered trees and forgotten ruins for a map said to reveal the forest’s secret exit. Guided by fleeting whispers and strange symbols etched into bark, Elric slowly unraveled the forest’s 
mystery. Each step brought him closer to the truth—that the woods were alive, watching, testing. Only by proving his courage and uncovering the final symbol could he escape its enchanted grasp.
